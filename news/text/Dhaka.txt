Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Atiqul Islam has said that the city's footpaths must be kept clear to reduce traffic congestion.The DNCC mayor made the remark while addressing a dialogue on the habitability of Dhaka city, arranged by Urban Development Journalists Forum (UDJF) at the National Press Club to mark its fourth anniversary on Saturday."Since many footpaths are occupied illegally, people are forced to walk on the roads. If we keep the footpaths clear, then traffic congestion will be reduced," he said, reports UNB.Ensuring road and food safety, adequate water supply, and freeing the wetlands from encroachers are among the challenges that need to be addressed to save the capital, Atiqul added."We need to work with responsibility to face these challenges," he said, mentioning that good governance is also a major factor.The DNCC mayor said illegally occupied city canals must be reclaimed to save Dhaka, as the blocking of the canals is largely responsible for water logging. "We are responsible for water logging and we are also the sufferers. To save the city, we have to free the canals by any means," he said. He also said that 18 new wards will be established in the eastern region of the Dhaka. "The new wards will be provided with a central waste management system," he added. Atiqul expressed his satisfaction as the country's readymade garment sector had thrived despite the negative global feedback after the Rana Plaza tragedy.About safe water supply, he said he had contacted the Wasa managing director regarding the matter.UDJF President Amitosh Paul, General Secretary Matin Abdullah, and Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) General Secretary Dr Adil Muhammad Khan also spoke at the event, among others.
