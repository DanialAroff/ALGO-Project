Under bright spring sunlight in Tokyo--a world apart from the dark flooded cave they were trapped in last summer--11 Thai boys were all smiles on their visit to the capital on April 5.

“I want to study, and I want to become a soccer player to make money for my parents,” said Chanin Viboonrungruang, 12, during his visit to the Japan Football Museum in Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward.

Chanin was one of the 12 members of a youth soccer team who were trapped in the flood-swollen cave following heavy rains in suburban Chiang Rai in northern Thailand in June 2018. The boys and their coach survived by sharing snacks in their possession until all were safely rescued by the 18th day, as the world's media followed every twist and turn of their plight.

During the rescue, ceramic tiles that glow a faint green underwater were used to help guide rescue divers and see each other. These tiles were developed by Codomo Energy Co., an Osaka-based building materials supplier.

The curious twist of fate connected the boys and the company, which organized their visit to Japan.

At the museum, the boys were presented the Japan national soccer team's uniforms by the museum director, Kuniya Daini.

The boys are scheduled to play a friendly match against local children at the J-Village sports complex located in Naraha and Hirono towns in Fukushima Prefecture on April 6.
