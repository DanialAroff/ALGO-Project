The Jakarta Council special committee for the deputy governor election has made plans to visit Riau Islands Legislative Council to learn about how to select a new deputy governor after the position was left vacant by Sandiaga Uno.
The committee had visited the neighboring Riau Province on May 22 although it had not disclosed results from the visit.
“From our visit to the two provinces, we received inputs on how to craft a code of conduct [on how to replace a deputy governor],” the committee’s head Muhamad “Ongen” Sangaji said, adding that Jakarta Council could soon begin move to select a new deputy governot, kompas.com reported.
“As the leader of this committee, I will make sure we will have a new deputy governor soon,” he added.
Earlier, Home Ministry's acting regional autonomy director general Akmal Malik proposed that the Jakarta Council should establish a code of conduct before electing a new deputy governor.
“We suggest [the city council] take the example of Jambi and Riau who have done a similar thing [elected a new deputy governor]. However we do not suggest [the city council] visit Riau Islands because [the new deputy governor] resigned there after being chosen,” Akmal said last Monday.
The deputy governor position has been vacant in the past in the past one year after Sandiaga Uno left the seat to run as Prabowo Subianto's vice presidential candidate. (ami)
