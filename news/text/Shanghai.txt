Yonghe Park reopened on Monday with a new and stylish look.

The park, at 702 Yuanping Road, in Jing'an District was built 30 years ago as one of the first batch of the city’s “pocket parks” to ensure residents have access to some green space.

However, the park no longer met modern needs. 

Renovation started on January 25 and was completed on April 29. It officially opened to the public at 8am on Monday.

The park covers an area of 14,510 square meters, the size of two standard soccer fields. 

The former ugly iron gate has been replaced by a new entrance, featuring white walls and black tiles creating the impression of an elegant Chinese-style garden.

As the park is close to the busy Middle Ring Road, tall trees have been planted to create a sound barrier. 

Trees also reflect the colors of the four seasons. They range from white magnolia flowers in the spring to the golden leaves of the maple in the fall.

The park features newly paved walking and jogging paths through the trees to allow people to breathe fresh air and enjoy the natural colors.

It also has a pavilion and children’s playground.

The park, which has free admission, is open from 5am to 10pm every day from May 1 to October 31, and from 6am to 9pm every day from November 1 to April 30.
